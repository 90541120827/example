    <p>I am Sahil, a 21-year-old Interactive Media Design student from India. I have a passion for creativity and I am always eager to learn new things. I enjoy exploring various forms of art and design,
       and I strive to incorporate them into my work. With a background in Interactive Media Design, 
       I am skilled in using design software and tools to bring ideas to life.
      </p>
    <p>Music is one of my greatest sources of inspiration and relaxation.
       I find solace in listening to different genres of music, and it often fuels my creativity. 
       Apart from my academic pursuits, I am an avid explorer. I love venturing into the unknown,
        whether it's traveling to new places, trying new cuisines, or engaging in unique experiences. 
        This curiosity and thirst for knowledge drive me to continuously expand my horizons and embrace new challenges.
